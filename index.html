<h1>N resources</h1>
<hr><br>
<p>This website is a historic memorial and a one place stop to explore all resources created over the years for the series of N games by <a href="https://www.metanetsoftware.com/">Metanet Software</a>.</p>
<p>The N community was born in 2004, and has since developed and extensive amount of content, which has often been scattered in the forums and lost with time, much of it is irrecoverable.
This content includes tools (for highscoring, mapping, fangames, webtools, and others), webpages (forums, chats, wikis, etc), documents (spreadsheets, graphs, mappacks, lists, etc)...</p>
<p>I've been downloading N stuff since 2007, and I realized my N folder had grown to be historically significant and contained many lost files. So I set up this page with a triple objective in mind:
<ul>
<li>As a one stop to find any resource, even when you already know them.</li>
<li>For people to find resources they didn't know about.</li>
<li>For historical preservation.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Below you can find the most relevant resources in a single table. Many more can be found if you browse the categories <b>above</b>, where they are properly organized and with additional information and descriptions.</p>
